He has three regular care workers who understand him and his needs. He likes to be and feel independent in his own house. He is a proud man and his care workers provide all the support he requires within his own home. He is happy and content, which makes me feel relieved and assured that he is well looked after.’ </p>

If a care worker is unable to come around and provide the support I need to look after my disabled son, they’re the first ones to call and apologize before sending me someone else who is just as qualified as my usual care provider.’ </p>

However, life started becoming more bearable and the joyous side of life started becoming more apparent thanks to the care worker who has been sent to me by Hope Care Agency. She is more than a care worker, as she has become my friend and looks after me and my needs at all times.’ </p>
