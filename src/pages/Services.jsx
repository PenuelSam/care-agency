          <p className="text-[20px] py-[10px]">Dementia is a relatively common condition, with the risk of developing dementia increasing as you get older. This condition usually occurs in people over the age of 65.</p>
          <p className="text-[20px] ">Dementia is associated with an ongoing decline in the brain and its abilities and can include problems with:</p>
          <ul className="text-[20px]  list-disc ml-[50px]">
            <li>memory loss (long and short term)</li>
            <li>the speed at which they think</li>
            <li>mental agility</li>
            <li>language</li>
            <li>understanding of a situation</li>
            <li>judgement</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-[20px] py-[10px] ">Often people with dementia can become uninterested in activities they were previously interested in and can also have difficulty controlling their emotions. A person with dementia may begin to find it difficult to plan or organise events which can cause them to forget to have meals or take medication, which makes leading an independent life more challenging.</p>
          <p className="text-[20px] py-[10px]">There are many different types of dementia some of which are explained below.</p>

          <h1 className="text-[15px] font-bold my-[10px]">Alzhemier</h1>
          <p className="text-[20px] py-[10px]">The most common form of dementia is Alzheimer’s and according to the NHS it affects an estimated 850,000 people in the UK.</p>
          <p className="text-[20px] py-[10px] ">Over the course of the disease proteins build up in the brain and form structures which are called ‘tangles’ or ‘plaques’. These structures can lead to the loss of connections between nerve cells, and ultimately to the death of nerve cells and loss of brain tissue.</p>
          <p className="text-[20px]">The cause of Alzheimer’s is not known but there are thought to be a number of factors that can increase your risks of developing the condition that include:</p>
          <ul className="text-[20px]  list-disc ml-[50px]">
            <li>increasing age</li>
            <li>a family history of Alzheimer’s</li>
            <li>previous severe head injuries</li>
            <li>conditions associated with cardiovascular disease</li>

          <h1 className="text-[15px] font-bold my-[10px]">Palliative care</h1>
          <p className="text-[20px] py-[10px]">The end of life care of someone with an advanced progressive illness will include palliative care. If someone has been diagnosed with an illness that can’t be cured then palliative care is to ensure that they are kept as comfortable as possible and are able to die with dignity. This includes pain management and more supportive care as well as providing support for the family and carers to help them cope with their own bereavement. Palliative care should provide the best quality of life for patients and their families.As a home care provider these are some of the services we offer.</p>
